# Building eCLM Documentation

If you'd like to develop and/or build the eCLM documentation, you should:

1. Switch to this directory: `cd docs`
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (it is recommended you do this within a virtual environment)
3. (Optional) Edit the books source files located in the `docs/` directory
4. Run `make clean docs`.
5. Launch the doc homepage on your default browser: `open _build/html/index.html`
