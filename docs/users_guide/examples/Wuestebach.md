# Single-Point Wuestebach

This test case at point scale covers the Wuestebach test site that is part of the TERENO network. Wuestebach is a forest site located in the Eifel region in Germany. To set up eCLM and run this test case, follow the instructions below.

## 1. Copy the namelist files
For JSC users, all required namelist and input files to run this case are in the shared directory `/p/scratch/cslts/shared_data/rlmod_eCLM`

```sh
mkdir test_cases
cp -r /p/scratch/cslts/shared_data/rlmod_eCLM/example_cases/wtb_1x1  test_cases/
cd test_cases/wtb_1x1
```

## 1. Download and extract data files (**For non JSC users**)

You can download all required files through the JSC datahub.
```sh
mkdir -p test_cases/1x1_wuestebach
wget https://datapub.fz-juelich.de/slts/eclm/1x1_wuestebach.tar.gz
tar xf 1x1_wuestebach.tar.gz -C test_cases/1x1_wuestebach
```
The repository contains two directories. The `common` directory contains some general input files necessary to run eCLM cases. The `wtb_1x1` directory contains the case specific domain and surface files as well as atmospheric forcing data and a script for namelist generation.

```sh
# Generate namelists
cd test_cases/1x1_wuestebach
export ECLM_SHARED_DATA=$(pwd)
cd wtb_1x1
clm5nl-gen wtb_1x1.toml

# Validate namelists
clm5nl-check .
```

## 2. Check the case setup
You can check out the important namelist files.

- The `lnd_in` file is the primary configuration file for the land model component in CLM. It includes settings related to various processes and configurations specific to land surface modeling. For a complete list of `lnd_in`-namelist options, see https://docs.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2/settings/current/clm5_0_nml.html

- The `drv_in` file configures the coupler and driver settings that control how different components of the Earth system model interact. It manages the synchronization and communication between components such as the atmosphere, land, ocean, and sea ice models. For a complete list of `drv_in`-namelist options, see https://docs.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2/settings/current/drv_nml.html


Print out the namelist files and look at the customized configurations.
```sh
cat lnd_in
cat drv_in
```

## 3. Run the test case

Customize the copied job script `run-eclm-job.sh` as desired. In this example, it is already customized to this test case, you should just adapt the SBATCH parameters `--account` to your compute project and `--partition` to your system. As Wuestebach is a single-column case, the number of processors should be set to 1 (SBATCH parameter `--ntasks-per-node=1`). 

**For non JSC users**: Create a job script in your case directory with:

```sh
cat << EOF > run-eclm-job.sh
```
Adapt the SBATCH parameters and then copy the following in the shell file:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#SBATCH --job-name=wtb_1x1
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1
#SBATCH --account=jibg36
#SBATCH --partition=batch
#SBATCH --time=1:00:00
#SBATCH --output=logs/%j.eclm.out
#SBATCH --error=logs/%j.eclm.err

ECLM_EXE=${eCLM_ROOT}/install/bin/eclm.exe
if [[ ! -f $ECLM_EXE || -z "$ECLM_EXE" ]]; then
  echo "ERROR: eCLM executable '$ECLM_EXE' does not exist."
  exit 1
fi

# Set PIO log files
if [[ -z $SLURM_JOB_ID || "$SLURM_JOB_ID" == " " ]]; then
  LOGID=$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H.%M.%S)
else 
  LOGID=$SLURM_JOB_ID
fi
mkdir -p logs timing/checkpoints
LOGDIR=$(realpath logs)
comps=(atm cpl esp glc ice lnd ocn rof wav)
for comp in ${comps[*]}; do
  LOGFILE="$LOGID.comp_${comp}.log"
  sed -i "s#diro.*#diro = \"$LOGDIR\"#" ${comp}_modelio.nml
  sed -i "s#logfile.*#logfile = \"$LOGFILE\"#" ${comp}_modelio.nml
done

# Run model
srun $ECLM_EXE
EOF
```

Then you can submit your job:

```sh
sbatch run-eclm-job.sh
```

To check the job status, run `sacct`.

The model run is successful if the history files (`wtb_1x1.clm2.h0.*.nc`) have been generated.
