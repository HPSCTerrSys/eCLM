# Introduction to eCLM

eCLM is based on version 5.0 of the Community Land Model ([CLM5](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/clm)) with simplified infrastructure for build and namelist generation. The build system is handled entirely by Cmake and namelists are generated through a small set of Python scripts. Similar to CLM5, eCLM is forced with meteorological data and uses numerous input streams on soil properties, land cover and land use, as well as complex parameter sets on crop phenology, and plant hydraulics for simulations.

The following section will give you a brief overview of CLM5.
