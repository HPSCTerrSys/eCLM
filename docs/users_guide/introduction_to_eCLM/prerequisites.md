# Prerequisites

## Linux systems

If you are new to using Linux systems, it’s helpful to get familiar with a couple of things which will make setting up and working in this environment easier.

### 1. Get familiar with linux command line 
There are many good resources on the internet to get familiar with the basic command line arguments to navigate through different directories, create folders and files, move or manipulate files etc..

### 2. Get familiar with a text editor
A text editor is very useful for quick and effective editing of files on Linux systems. There are different options for text editors like [vim](https://www.vim.org/) or [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/). Vim is already installed on the JSC systems. Look for a cheat sheet or a tutorial online or check the documentation on their official websites.

## netCDF files

NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is a file format for storing multidimensional scientific data (variables). In order to handle model input and output data for eCLM, you will need to be able to work with this file format. If you are not familiar with it yet, look for some resources or tutorials online. A quick introduction to netCDF can, for example, be found [here](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/data/multidimensional/what-is-netcdf-data.htm).
