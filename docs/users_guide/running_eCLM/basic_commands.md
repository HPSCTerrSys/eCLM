# Basic commands to run eCLM

Begin by logging in to the JSC (or another) system. Then, source the eCLM environment file.

```sh
source load-eclm-variables.sh
```

Next create a folder called `cases` or similar in your main eLCM directory and in that directory create a directory for your new case.

```sh
mkdir -p cases/"your case name"
```
